# Spotify Randomizer API

The API is an express server that communicates with Spotify's API. 

To run standalone (or with node), an `.env` file must be made with the following fields:
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: the client ID of your spotify dev app
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: the secret value of your spotify dev app
